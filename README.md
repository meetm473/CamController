# CamController

An android application that searches for a green colored object in the environment and approaches the object. This object can also be used as controller. The application sends actuating commands to the Arduino Uno connected to the android smartphone via UART. OpenCV library is used for image processing.

## Hardware setup to test the application

## Motivation for the project
- To understand the sub-systems involved in the development of an autonomous/semi-autonomous robot.
- To build a mobile robot without the use of multiple independent microprocessors, controller, and sensors procured from the marketplace.
